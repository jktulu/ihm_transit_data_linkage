# IHM Transit Data Linkage

This repository is a collection of code required for the successful linkage of Automated Fare Collection Data (AFC), Automated Vehicle Location Data (AVL) and Bus Timetables using data provided by a "Regional Transport Provider" in the UK.

IHM_0 files are those associated with the original data cleaning and preparation.
IHM_1 files are concered with linking AFC, AVL and Timetable for overlapping time periods.
IHM_2 files extend those from IHM and are employed to infer boarding locations where AVL data are not available.

For full details of the data-linkage process please see the project Wiki.
